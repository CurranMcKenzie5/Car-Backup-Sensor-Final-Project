# Car-Backup-Sensor-Final-Project

Our goal in the final project for our introduction to engineering class was to create a car back up
sensor. We used arduino unos and breadboards in order to create a functioning car backup sensor. The 
features we created included an led board with the distance from an object displayed on it. Other features
include a buzzer with a change in frequency the closer they are to an object and an led with the same 
capabilities. This was a very interesting project to follow through from start to finish.

Why we chose this project: 

Professor Rodriguez demonstration during the first week of class intrigued us 

Also, We chose to do this project because we found it to be very interesting, 
especially since it applies to something that many people use every day



The Result:

The result that we hope to achieve, is a sensor which will display, on an LED screen, 
the distance that it is from an object. We will add warning signs on the screen as well. 
Also, we plan to add a buzzer and LED's which will buzz and flash at a frequency that is 
proportional to the distance that the sensor is from the object it is approaching. This will
make the buzzer and LED's go off faster, the closer that the sensor is to something. The 
finished product will be the equivalent of a real car's backup sensor, minus the camera of course.
